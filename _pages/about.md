I am a research scientist at Facebook NYC. I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I am broadly interested in distributed systems and backend technologies.

Projects
======
* IBM Streams Beam Runner
	IBM Streams is a high-throughput low-latency analytic platform for streaming data applications. I work on multiple research issues in IBM Streams, including transform graph translation and optimization, out-of-order event arrival processing, large window aggregation, etc. Currently, I lead a small team of four people to adopt Apache Beam model into IBM Streams, which involves filling in the model gaps between Beam and Streams, indexing/garbage-collecting Beam transform states, and managing operator parallelism. Our work produces both research papers and a product (IBM Streams Beam runner toolkit) deployed in IBM Cloud which won 2018 IBM Outstanding Technical Achievement Award.
* Stark: Optimizing In-Memory Computation For Online User Queries
	In this project, we explored the possibility of combining in-memory computation frameworks with the backend of online services to answer massive user queries in real-time. Success along this path would push online services beyond the existing store-index-retrieve design pattern, allowing the backend to afford relatively complex data analytic algorithms to serve every user query with highly optimized results. This project tackles this problem by optimizing Apache Spark for online queries.
